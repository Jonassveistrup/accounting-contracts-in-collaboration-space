## Background video describing REA principles

In June 2020 Bill recorded an excellent American Accounting Association SPARK keynote video describing the history of the Resource Entity Agent (REA) model, its principles, and the overview relationship of OeDBTR directly to REA. This is an excellent introduction to REA that is geared to accountants.
